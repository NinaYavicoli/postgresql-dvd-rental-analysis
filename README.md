# SQL DVD Rental Analysis

This repository contains a PostgreSQL-based SQL project completed as part of the D326 Advanced Data Management course at Western Governors University (WGU). The project focuses on analyzing customer rental behavior within a DVD rental database and demonstrates the creation of analytical report tables, data transformations using functions, and automated summary updates.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze how frequently films are rented and how long they are typically checked out in order to identify high-demand titles and support inventory planning decisions.  
The analysis is structured using both detailed, transaction-level data and aggregated summary metrics.

**Tools & Technologies**
- PostgreSQL
- SQL (PL/pgSQL)

---

## Repository Contents

- `report_queries.sql`  
  Final SQL used to create report tables and generate analytical outputs.

- `test_and_demo_functions.sql`  
  Additional SQL functions and test queries created for a live project demonstration, showcasing function creation, validation logic, and transformations.

- `project-design-report.pdf`  
  Written project documentation outlining business objectives, report structure, data fields, and transformation logic.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Designing detailed and summary reporting tables
- Writing user-defined SQL functions for data transformation
- Creating triggers to automatically maintain summary tables
- Using stored procedures to refresh analytical data
- Translating business requirements into structured SQL solutions

---

## How to Use

The SQL files can be executed in a PostgreSQL environment using the standard DVD rental dataset.  
Queries are organized and commented for clarity and reproducibility.
